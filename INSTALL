DIFFBOT C++ CLIENT

  This is the official C++ client library for Diffbot API service.
  It provides access for Diffbot API via HTTP protocol.
  It is indended to be used by C++ software developers.

INSTALLING

  Diffbot client is dependent on the following 3rd party open-source libraries:

  1) JSONCPP library is used for parsing JSON response from the diffbot server.
    There are several alternative ways how to obtain the JSONCPP library:
    
    a) Use the library provided in deps/ directory
    
    b) Download from JSONCPP homepage: http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/
    
    c) Install using OS package manager. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian Linux:
    sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev
    
    d) Checkout from SVN repository:
    svn co http://jsoncpp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsoncpp/trunk/
  
  2) CURL library is used in order to perform HTTP requests to diffbot server.
    In most Linux distributives it is installed by default.

    Homepage: http://curl.haxx.se/
    
    How to obtain it:

    a) Use the library provided in deps/ directory (for MSVC only)

    b) Download link: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html (for any platform)

BUILDING AND TESTING

  1) Linux (GNU C++):

    Type the following command in shell:

      $ make test

    This will build the diffbot executable.
    It can be used to run tests which get the article content from any website, i.e. http://www.diffbot.com/

    Diffbot executable usage:
      $ ./diffbot <website_url> [<method>]
      (<method> is optional)

    For example:
      $ ./diffbot http://www.diffbot.com article

    You will need GNU C++ compiler with standard set of libraries.

    The following other options are available:

       $ make all       - build up, but do not run test
       $ make clean     - clean up object and executable files

  2) Windows (MSVC):

    You will need to create a solution and add Diffbot client's header and source files.
    Also you will need to add the dependent libraries and their header files.
    Please refer to your IDE and compiler documentation if needed.

    Notes on Windows platform:
      - We recommend to turn Unicode support off for better compatibility.
      - We recommend to turn precompiled headers off.
      - You will need to specify Include and Library paths in your project configuration.
      - ZLIB1.DLL is needed to make CURL library work (its provided in deps/ directory).
      - We recommend to copy ZLIB1.DLL and LIBCURL.DLL into Windows/System32 directory.
